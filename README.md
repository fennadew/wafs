## Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks
 ### Advantages
  - Costs less time.
  - Is behind a whole community where you can make things yourself.
  - Gives you stable structure of code and features.
  - Faster and easier learning curve.
  - Good quality code.

 
 ### Disadvantages
 - Sometimes you do not need a framework.
 - Frameworks can be somewhat heavier.
 - Code is updated quickly so you have to convert it.
 - Popularity quickly switches so you often have to change the framework.
 - Debugging can be more difficult.

## Advantages and disadvantages of client-side single page web apps
 ### Advantages
 - Faster.
 - Most elements only need to be load once.
 - The data can be cached locally. This way the data can also be retrieved offline.
 
 
  ### Disadvantages
 - Only working with JavaScript.
 - Less safe than normal applications. XSS makes it easier to be attacked.
